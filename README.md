# Live Project for Easy-Donate internship - Instagram Profile Page Clone

(unfinished)
This is my live project for the Easy-Donate internship, which will be an attempt to make a similar 
design to the profile tab on the Instagram app. The goal of the app is to test out what I've learned 
so far from the bootcamp about making an app with a nice interface as well as managing the state of
the app through user interactions. Functionalities like editing text should be similar to what I 
have experience in the bootcamp and TDD course. In addition to that, this project will involve the
uploading of images as well from the device the app operates on which will be a bit different than 
what I have worked on previously so that may require some research to get down that functionality.
